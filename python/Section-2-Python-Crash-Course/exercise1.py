# Coding Exercise 1: Declare Variables

# Declare a season variable and assign it a string of your favorite season (Summer, Fall, Spring, or Winter)
# Make sure the first letter of the season is capitalized.

# Declare a lucky_number variable and assign it to your favorite number.

# Declare a hard_math variable and assign it to the sum of 3, 4 and 5 (HINT: use the + symbol to get Python
# to add the numbesr for you)

# Declare a my_str variable set to a string of "3".

season = "Spring"
lucky_number = 11
hard_math = 3 + 4 + 5
my_str = "3"
