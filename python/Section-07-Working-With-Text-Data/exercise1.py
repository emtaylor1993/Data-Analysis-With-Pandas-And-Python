# Let's start by importing pandas below
import pandas as pd

# This challenge includes a data.csv dataset.
# The dataset has 3 columns: Name, Title, Cryptocurrency
# Import the dataset and assign the DataFrame to a "data" variable.
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Unfortunately, some of the text data has been incorrectly exported.

# The strings in the Name column are all lowercased.
# Capitalize the names properly (so the first letter of the person's first and last names are uppercase)
# Then, overwrite the Name column with the new Series.
data["Name"] = data["Name"].str.title()

# Lowercase the strings in the Title column.
# Then, overwrite the Title column with the new Series.
data["Title"] = data["Title"].str.lower()

# Uppercase the strings in the Cryptocurrency column.
# Then, overwrite the Cryptocurrency column with the new Series.
data["Cryptocurrency"] = data["Cryptocurrency"].str.upper()
